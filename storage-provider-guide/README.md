# Storage Provider Guide

A storage provider in the EthStorage network is an active participant responsible for securely storing data. They store blob data on behalf of the network and receive storage fees as rewards for their service.

## Become a Storage Provider

Within the EthStorage network, storage providers operate storage nodes (a.k.a. es-node) to download and store data of their interest, subsequently receiving rewards distributed by the storage contract.

The storage providers must provide proof of replication over time to collect rewards. This process is sometimes called "mining", and the storage provider is called a "miner".

During the initial launch, participation as a storage provider is limited to whitelisted operators. Once the network reaches stability, it will transition to a fully permissionless model.
